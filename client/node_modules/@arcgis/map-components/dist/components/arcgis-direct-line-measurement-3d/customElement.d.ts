 * The Direct Line Measurement 3D component can be added to a [Scene](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/references/map-components/arcgis-scene/)
 * component to calculate and display vertical, horizontal, and direct distances between two points.
 *
 * [![measurement-line-3d](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/assets/img/apiref/widgets/3D_DirectLineMeasurement_widget.png)](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/sample-code/measurement-3d/)
 *
 * How distances are computed depends on the scene's spatial reference.
 *
 * In **geographic coordinate systems** (GCS) and in **Web Mercator**:
 * - Direct distance is computed in a Euclidean manner, in an [ECEF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECEF) coordinate system (or equivalent on other planets);
 * - Horizontal distance is computed geodetically, taking into consideration the curvature of the planet;
 * - Vertical distance is computed as an elevation difference.
 *
 * In **projected coordinate systems** (PCS), apart from Web Mercator, all three distances (direct, horizontal, and vertical)
 *  are computed in a Euclidean manner (in their respective PCS).
 *
 * Direct Line Measurement 3D component visualizes and labels the direct, horizontal, and vertical distances and displays the same values
 * in the UI panel. When the distance between the points is greater than 100 kilometers,
 * the measurement visualization is simplified, and only the horizontal and vertical distances are calculated.
 * The direct distance option becomes unavailable.
 *
 * ![measurement-line-3d](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/assets/img/apiref/widgets/direct-line-measurement-3d.png)
 *
 * When the component is active, a horizontal "laser" line is drawn which indicates the height at the current mouse position.
 * This line can help in analyzing the heights of objects relative to each other and the terrain.
 * A second laser line shows the intersection of the scene with the vertical plane that passes through the checkered line.
 *
 * **Things to consider**
 *
 * * Direct Line Measurement 3D is designed to work in the Scene component. For measurements in the [Map](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/references/map-components/arcgis-map/)
 * component, use [Distance Measurement 2D](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/references/map-components/arcgis-distance-measurement-2d/).
 * * Snapping is enabled by default. This can be temporarily disabled by holding the `CTRL` key.
 * * Layer types currently supported for snapping are:
 * [FeatureLayer](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-layers-FeatureLayer.html),
 * [GraphicsLayer](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-layers-GraphicsLayer.html) (except Mesh geometries),
 * [GeoJSONLayer](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-layers-GeoJSONLayer.html),
 * [WFSLayer](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-layers-WFSLayer.html),
 * [CSVLayer](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-layers-CSVLayer.html),
 * [3D Object SceneLayer](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-layers-SceneLayer.html),
 * and [BuildingSceneLayer](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-layers-BuildingSceneLayer.html).
