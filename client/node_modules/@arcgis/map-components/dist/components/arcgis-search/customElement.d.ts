 * The Search component provides a way to perform search operations on locator service(s), map/feature service feature layer(s), SceneLayers with an associated feature layer,
 * BuildingComponentSublayer with an associated feature layer, GeoJSONLayer, CSVLayer, OGCFeatureLayer, and/or table(s). If using a locator with a geocoding service, the
 * findAddressCandidates operation is used, whereas queries are used on feature layers.
 *
 * By default, the Search component uses the ArcGIS World Geocoding Service via this URL: `https://geocode.arcgis.com/arcgis/rest/services/World/GeocodeServer`.
 * If a global apiKey is present, the Search component uses this URL: `https://geocode-api.arcgis.com/arcgis/rest/services/World/GeocodeServer`. If an apiKey
 * is present on the LocatorSearchSource, then the Search component uses the URL defined by the LocatorSearchSource.url property.
 *
 * The Search component sets the view on the Search result. The level of detail (LOD) at the center of the view depends on the data source, with higher quality data
 * sources returning extents closer to the `feature` obtained from the search. To manually define the scale of the view at the Search result, use the `zoomScale` property
 * of the LocatorSearchSource or LayerSearchSource. Search component results are typically sorted according to their relevance to the search and their relative importance.
 * However, when the scale of the MapView or SceneView is less than or equal to 300,000, the operations support prioritization of candidates based on their distance from a
 * specified point (the center of the view) by passing in the `location parameter`. Features closest to the input location show up higher in the list of results.
 * This behavior can be changed by using the localSearchDisabled property.
