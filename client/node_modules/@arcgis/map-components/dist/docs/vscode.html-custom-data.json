      "description": "The Area Measurement 3D component can be added to a [Scene](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/references/map-components/arcgis-scene/)\ncomponent to calculate and display area and perimeter of polygons.\n\n[![measurement-area-3d](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/assets/img/apiref/widgets/3D_AreaMeasurement_widget.png)](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/sample-code/measurement-3d/)\n\nHow the area and perimeter are computed depends on the scene's spatial reference and the length of the measured perimeter.\n\nIn **geographic coordinate systems** (GCS) and in **Web Mercator**:\n- If the measurement's perimeter is below 100 km, they are computed in a Euclidean manner,\n  in an [ECEF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECEF) coordinate system (or equivalent on other planets).\n- If the perimeter is above 100 km, they are computed geodetically, and the visualization takes\n  the curvature of the planet into consideration.\n\nIn **projected coordinate systems** (PCS), apart from Web Mercator, the area and perimeter\nare always calculated in a Euclidean manner (in their respective PCS).\n\nThe area may be visualized and calculated in two ways:\n1. If all the vertices are mostly coplanar (lying on the same plane),\n   the measurement polygon is formed on that plane, and area and perimeter are calculated from its geometry.\n2. If the vertices don't form a planar surface, the measurement polygon\n   is projected to a horizontal plane, and area and perimeter are calculated from its geometry.\n\n![area-measurement-3d-types](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/assets/img/apiref/widgets/area-measurement-3d-types.png)\n\nWhen the component is active, a horizontal \"laser\" line is drawn which indicates the height at the current mouse position.\nThis line can help in analyzing the heights of objects relative to each other and the terrain.\n\n**Things to consider**\n\n* Area Measurement 3D is designed to work in the Scene component. For measurements in the [Map](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/references/map-components/arcgis-map/)\ncomponent, use [Area Measurement 2D](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/references/map-components/arcgis-area-measurement-2d/).\n* Snapping is enabled by default.

When the distance between the points is greater than 100 kilometers,\nthe measurement visualization is simplified, and only the horizontal and vertical distances are calculated.\nThe direct distance option becomes unavailable.\n\n![measurement-line-3d](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/assets/img/apiref/widgets/direct-line-measurement-3d.png)\n\nWhen the component is active, a horizontal \"laser\" line is drawn which indicates the height at the current mouse position.\nThis line can help in analyzing the heights of objects relative to each other and the terrain.\nA second laser line shows the intersection of the scene with the vertical plane that passes through the checkered line.\n\n**Things to consider**\n\n* Direct Line Measurement 3D is designed to work in the Scene component. For measurements in the [Map](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/references/map-components/arcgis-map/)\ncomponent, use [Distance Measurement 2D](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/references/map-components/arcgis-distance-measurement-2d/).\n* Snapping is enabled by default.

Visibility between a given observer and multiple target points is calculated against the currently\ndisplayed content in the view, including the ground, integrated meshes, and 3D objects such as buildings or trees.\n\n![line-of-sight](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/assets/img/apiref/widgets/line-of-sight.png)\n\nThe analysis results are displayed as colored lines, where areas visible to the observer are\nshown green and occluded parts are marked in red. Also, the color of the target points indicates their visibility.\nWhen the line of sight cannot be calculated, it will be displayed with a gray color. This may happen if either\nthe target or the observer is not in the view.\n\nWhen creating a new line of sight analysis, the first click in the Scene creates the\n[observer](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-analysis-LineOfSightAnalysisObserver.html)\nand subsequent clicks place the [targets](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-analysis-LineOfSightAnalysisTarget.html).\nBoth the observer and target points can be moved by dragging.

Create a promise that resolves once component is fully loaded.\n- `destroy(): Promise<void>` - Destroys the view, and any associated resources, including its map, popup, and UI elements.\n- `goTo(target: __esri.GoToTarget2D, options?: __esri.GoToOptions2D): Promise<unknown>` - Sets the view to a given target.\n- `hitTest(screenPoint: __esri.MapViewScreenPoint | MouseEvent, options?: __esri.MapViewHitTestOptions): Promise<__esri.HitTestResult>` - Returns hit test results from each layer that intersects the specified screen coordinates.\n- `openPopup(options?: __esri.PopupViewOpenPopupOptions): Promise<void>` - Opens the popup at the given location with content defined either explicitly with content or driven\nfrom the PopupTemplate of input features.\n- `takeScreenshot(options?: __esri.MapViewTakeScreenshotOptions): Promise<__esri.Screenshot>` - Create a screenshot of the current view.\n- `toMap(screenPoint: __esri.MapViewScreenPoint | MouseEvent): __esri.Point`\n- `toScreen(point: __esri.Point, options?: __esri.ToScreenOptions2D): __esri.MapViewScreenPoint | nullish`\n- `tryFatalErrorRecovery(): Promise<void>` - Call this method to clear any fatal errors resulting from a lost WebGL context.\n- `viewOnReady(callback?: (): void, errback?: (error: Error) => void): Promise<void>` - `viewOnReady()` may be leveraged once an instance of the component and its underlying [view](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/references/map-components/arcgis-map/#view) is created and ready.\nThis method takes two input parameters, a `callback` function and an `errback` function, and returns a promise.

One is provided that shows the map only, while another provides a layout with legend, etc.\nThe Print component works with the [print](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-rest-print.html) module, which generates a printer-ready version of the map.\n\nThe Print component uses the ArcGIS Online print service by default, but it can be configured to use a custom print service with the [printServiceUrl](#printServiceUrl) property.\nThe component can preserve map scale or map extent in the printout. By default, the map extent is preserved. Use\n[TemplateOptions.scaleEnabled](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-widgets-Print-TemplateOptions.html#scaleEnabled) to preserve scale instead.\n\nThe Print component prints a localized date for all [layouts](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-rest-support-PrintTemplate.html#layout)\nexcept `map-only`. If using a custom print service, then `customTextElements` are supported for each print\ntemplate. Values found there will be populated in the Print component under `Advanced options`. These values can\nbe overwritten in the Print component UI, or programmatically using the\n[templateCustomTextElements](#templateCustomTextElements) property.\n\nFor more information about printing with the `MAP_ONLY` layout, please see\n[exportOptions](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-rest-support-PrintTemplate.html#exportOptions).\n\n**Known limitations**\n\nSee [print](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-rest-print.html) for a detailed list of known limitations.\n\n```html\n<arcgis-map item-id=\"45725ba7d9fb47a0925398919b13d1fa\">\n <arcgis-print position=\"top-right\"></arcgis-print>\n</arcgis-map>\n```\n\n```js\n// get a reference to the component\nconst components = document.querySelectorAll(\"arcgis-print\");\n\nconst portal = new Portal({\n url: \"https://user.maps.arcgis.com/sharing\",\n authMode: \"immediate\",\n authorizedCrossOriginDomains: [\"https://user.maps.arcgis.com\"],\n});\n\ncomponents.forEach((component) => {\n component.portal = portal;\n});\n```\n--\n\n### Events\n- **arcgisComplete** - Emitted when the component is complete.\n- **arcgisPropertyChange** - Emitted when the value of a property is changed.

If using a locator with a geocoding service, the\nfindAddressCandidates operation is used, whereas queries are used on feature layers.\n\nBy default, the Search component uses the ArcGIS World Geocoding Service via this URL: `https://geocode.arcgis.com/arcgis/rest/services/World/GeocodeServer`.\nIf a global apiKey is present, the Search component uses this URL: `https://geocode-api.arcgis.com/arcgis/rest/services/World/GeocodeServer`. If an apiKey\nis present on the LocatorSearchSource, then the Search component uses the URL defined by the LocatorSearchSource.url property.\n\nThe Search component sets the view on the Search result. The level of detail (LOD) at the center of the view depends on the data source, with higher quality data\nsources returning extents closer to the `feature` obtained from the search. To manually define the scale of the view at the Search result, use the `zoomScale` property\nof the LocatorSearchSource or LayerSearchSource. Search component results are typically sorted according to their relevance to the search and their relative importance.\nHowever, when the scale of the MapView or SceneView is less than or equal to 300,000, the operations support prioritization of candidates based on their distance from a\nspecified point (the center of the view) by passing in the `location parameter`. Features closest to the input location show up higher in the list of results.\nThis behavior can be changed by using the localSearchDisabled property.\n--\n\n### Events\n- **arcgisPropertyChange** - Emitted when the value of a property is changed. Use this to listen to changes to properties.\n- **arcgisReady** - Emitted when the component associated with a map or scene view is is ready to be interacted with.\n- **arcgisSearchClear** - Fires when a result is cleared from the input box or a new result is selected.\n- **arcgisSearchComplete** - Fires when the [search()](#search) method is called and returns its results.\n- **arcgisSearchStart** - Fires when the [search()](#search) method starts.\n- **arcgisSelectResult** - Fires when a search result is selected.\n- **arcgisSuggestComplete** - Fires when the [suggest](#suggest) method is called and returns its results.\n- **arcgisSuggestStart** - Fires when the [suggest()](#suggest) method starts.\n\n### Methods\n- `clear(): void` - Clears the current searchTerm, search results, suggest results, graphic, and graphics layer.\nIt also hides any open menus.\n- `componentOnReady(): Promise<void>` - Create a promise that resolves once component is fully loaded.\n- `destroy(): Promise<void>` - Permanently destroy the component.\n- `search(searchItem?: __esri.Graphic | __esri.Point | __esri.SuggestResult | Nil | number[] | string): Promise<__esri.SearchResponse | Nil>` - Depending on the sources specified, search() queries the feature layer(s) and/or performs\naddress matching using any specified [locator(s)](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-rest-locator.html) and\nreturns any applicable results.\n- `setFocus(): Promise<void>` - Brings focus to the component's text input.\n- `suggest(query?: string): Promise<__esri.SuggestResponse | Nil>` - Performs a suggest() request on the active Locator.

The user can\nconfigure the time range and select a calendar date. This time range and calendar date are only used\nfor the shadow analysis and are not connected to the lighting in the scene.\nTo control the lighting in the scene, the [Daylight](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/references/map-components/arcgis-daylight/) component can be used.\nChanging the timezone in the component updates the visualization by interpreting the time range as being\nin that timezone. This behavior is different from the [Daylight](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/references/map-components/arcgis-daylight/) component,\nwhere selecting a timezone updates the [environment lighting's](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/references/map-components/arcgis-scene/#environment) date and time according to the camera position.\n\nThe component provides three [visualization modes](#visualizationType): threshold, duration, and discrete mode.\n\nIn the **threshold** mode, only the areas that receive\nshadows for more than a certain amount of time are displayed. In the image below, on May 1, 2021 the red areas receive\nshadow for more than 4 hours within the time interval of 10AM to 4PM.\n\n[![threshold mode](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/assets/img/apiref/widgets/shadow-cast/shadow-cast-threshold.png)](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/sample-code/shadow-cast/)\n\n**Total shadow duration** mode displays the duration of the cumulative shadow using opacity: areas that don't\nreceive any shadow are fully transparent and areas that receive a maximum amount of shadow have a default opacity\nof 0.7. The values in between are interpolated. Hovering over the Scene will display a tooltip showing the\namount of time that location is in shadow, rounded to 15-minute intervals. In this mode, the visualization\ncan display shadow cast in a continuous way or in 1-hour intervals.\n\n[![duration mode](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/assets/img/apiref/widgets/shadow-cast/shadow-cast-duration.png)](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/sample-code/shadow-cast/)\n\n**Discrete shadows** is a third visualization mode which displays individual shadows at a given time interval.\nFor example, setting the time range to 10AM-11AM and the visualization time interval to 30 minutes will display\nshadows for 10AM, 10:30AM and 11:00AM.\n\n[![discrete mode](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/assets/img/apiref/widgets/shadow-cast/shadow-cast-discrete.png)](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/sample-code/shadow-cast/)\n\nThe defaults for the time range and visualization settings can be changed using the [startTimeOfDay](#startTimeOfDay), [endTimeOfDay](#endTimeOfDay), and [visualizationType](#visualizationType) properties.\n\n**Known limitations**\n\n* Shadow Cast is only supported in a 3D [Scene](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/references/map-components/arcgis-scene/) component.\n* Terrain does not cast shadows and it is therefore not taken into account in this analysis.\n* The component does not take into account the daylight savings.\nUse the timezone dropdown to adjust the offset from the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and account for the daylight saving time.\n* The timezone is automatically detected by the component based on the camera location. In some situations, this might not be accurate.\nIn case of an inaccurate timezone, users can set it manually using the timezone dropdown.\n\n**See also**\n\n- [Sample - Shadow cast component](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/sample-code/shadow-cast/)\n--\n\n### Events\n- **arcgisPropertyChange** - Emitted when the value of a property is changed. Use this to listen to changes to properties.\n- **arcgisReady** - Emitted when the component associated with a map or scene view is is ready to be interacted with.\n\n### Methods\n- `componentOnReady(): Promise<void>` - Create a promise that resolves once component is fully loaded.\n- `destroy(): Promise<void>` - Permanently destroy the component.\n- `getDuration(point: __esri.Point): Promise<number>` - Returns the time (in milliseconds) spent in shadow for a certain point on the screen.\n\n[Read more](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-widgets-ShadowCast-ShadowCastViewModel.html#getDuration)\n- `start(): Promise<void>` - Starts the component.
