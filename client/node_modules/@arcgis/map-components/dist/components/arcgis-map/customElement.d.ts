/**
 * The ArcGIS Map component is used to add 2D maps to web applications. For 3D maps, use the
 * [ArcGIS Scene component](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/references/map-components/arcgis-scene/).
 *
 * The Map component creates a [MapView](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-views-MapView.html) and loads a WebMap from either [ArcGIS Online](https://www.arcgis.com/home/index.html) or [ArcGIS Enterprise portal](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/administer/windows/what-is-portal-for-arcgis-.htm).
 *
 * ```html
 * <arcgis-map item-id="05e015c5f0314db9a487a9b46cb37eca"></arcgis-map>
 * ```
 *
 * Alternatively, the Map component can be initialized without a WebMap item.
 *
 * ```html
 * <arcgis-map basemap="satellite" center="-154.88, 19.46" zoom="15"></arcgis-map>
 * ```
 *
 * Other components can be added and connected to the Map component.
 *
 * ```html
 * <arcgis-map item-id="05e015c5f0314db9a487a9b46cb37eca">
 *  <arcgis-zoom position="top-left"></arcgis-zoom>
 *  <arcgis-legend position="bottom-left"></arcgis-legend>
 * </arcgis-map>
 * ```
 *
 * The Map component can be customized further using any of the [core API functionalities](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/) of the ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript.
 *
 * ```js
 * const viewElement = document.querySelector("arcgis-map");
 * viewElement.addEventListener("arcgisViewReadyChange", () => {
 *  const layer = new GraphicsLayer({ title: "My Layer" });
 *  viewElement.map.add(layer);
 * });
 * ```
