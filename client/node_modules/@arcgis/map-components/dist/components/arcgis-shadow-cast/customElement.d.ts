/**
 * The Shadow Cast component displays the cumulative shadows of 3D features in a [Scene](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/references/map-components/arcgis-scene/).
 * This type of analysis is helpful in urban development, where new projects have to satisfy certain shadow duration constraints.
 *
 * The component calculates the cumulative shadows for a time range during a single day. The user can
 * configure the time range and select a calendar date. This time range and calendar date are only used
 * for the shadow analysis and are not connected to the lighting in the scene.
 * To control the lighting in the scene, the [Daylight](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/references/map-components/arcgis-daylight/) component can be used.
 * Changing the timezone in the component updates the visualization by interpreting the time range as being
 * in that timezone. This behavior is different from the [Daylight](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/references/map-components/arcgis-daylight/) component,
 * where selecting a timezone updates the [environment lighting's](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/references/map-components/arcgis-scene/#environment) date and time according to the camera position.
 *
 * The component provides three [visualization modes](#visualizationType): threshold, duration, and discrete mode.
 *
 * In the **threshold** mode, only the areas that receive
 * shadows for more than a certain amount of time are displayed. In the image below, on May 1, 2021 the red areas receive
 * shadow for more than 4 hours within the time interval of 10AM to 4PM.
 *
 * [![threshold mode](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/assets/img/apiref/widgets/shadow-cast/shadow-cast-threshold.png)](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/sample-code/shadow-cast/)
 *
 * **Total shadow duration** mode displays the duration of the cumulative shadow using opacity: areas that don't
 * receive any shadow are fully transparent and areas that receive a maximum amount of shadow have a default opacity
 * of 0.7. The values in between are interpolated. Hovering over the Scene will display a tooltip showing the
 * amount of time that location is in shadow, rounded to 15-minute intervals. In this mode, the visualization
 * can display shadow cast in a continuous way or in 1-hour intervals.
 *
 * [![duration mode](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/assets/img/apiref/widgets/shadow-cast/shadow-cast-duration.png)](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/sample-code/shadow-cast/)
 *
 * **Discrete shadows** is a third visualization mode which displays individual shadows at a given time interval.
 * For example, setting the time range to 10AM-11AM and the visualization time interval to 30 minutes will display
 * shadows for 10AM, 10:30AM and 11:00AM.
 *
 * [![discrete mode](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/assets/img/apiref/widgets/shadow-cast/shadow-cast-discrete.png)](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/sample-code/shadow-cast/)
 *
 * The defaults for the time range and visualization settings can be changed using the [startTimeOfDay](#startTimeOfDay), [endTimeOfDay](#endTimeOfDay), and [visualizationType](#visualizationType) properties.
 *
 * **Known limitations**
 *
 * * Shadow Cast is only supported in a 3D [Scene](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/references/map-components/arcgis-scene/) component.
 * * Terrain does not cast shadows and it is therefore not taken into account in this analysis.
 * * The component does not take into account the daylight savings.
 * Use the timezone dropdown to adjust the offset from the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and account for the daylight saving time.
 * * The timezone is automatically detected by the component based on the camera location. In some situations, this might not be accurate.
 * In case of an inaccurate timezone, users can set it manually using the timezone dropdown.
